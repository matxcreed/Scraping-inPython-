YTS Scraping

This project is a web scraper built with Python and Scrapy to extract information from YTS and store it in a MongoDB database.
Its main goal is to demonstrate how to implement a complete scraping workflow with pagination and custom user-agent to simulate a real browser.
‚ú® Features

    Structured scraping using Scrapy.

    Automatic pagination to crawl multiple result pages.

    Custom User-Agent to avoid basic blocks.

    MongoDB storage for the scraped data.

    Designed for learning purposes by hobbyists and students.

üì¶ Requirements

    Python 3.9+

    MongoDB installed and running

    Python libraries:

        scrapy

        pymongo

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install scrapy pymongo

üöÄ Usage

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/matxcreed/YTS-Scraping.git
cd YTS-Scraping

    Set up your MongoDB connection in the project configuration file (e.g., settings.py).
